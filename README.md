# Spatial-Scaling-of-Mutualistic-Networks
AllStudiesNetworkData.csv - Input file for analysis; Column 1 is the Patch ID as given by the cited study, column 2 is the patch area in square meters, column 3 is the species richness of the lower taxonomic group within the network, column 4 is the species richness of the upper taxonomic group within the network, column 5 is the interaction richness of the network, column 6 is the conntance multiplied by 100, column 7 is the nickname for the dataset, column 8 is the type of mutualistic network described in the dataset, column 9 lists all datasets as composed of mutualists, column 10 lists the type of connectivity of the patches within the dataset
IAR_and_NAR_model_comparison.R - R script (analysis code) for fitting connectance-area relationships, species-area relationships, and link-species relationships for each of the three datasets; using the posterior distributions of the variables within these models to create posterior predictions of interaction richness given the three hypothesized network-area relationships (Equations 9 and both alternative hypotheses of equation 10 within the manuscript); and calculates residual sum of squares for each of the hypothesized network-area relationships
